Many of the examples and sentences here are directly adopted from The Rust Book . Compile and Run a single file \u00b6 When there's only one file, we can use rustc main.rs to compile (just like javac in Java ) and then use ./main.rs to run it. Compile and Run a project \u00b6 Cargo is the powerful package manager of Rust. It is easy to use, only several commands can satisfy most of the daily usage. Useful Commands \u00b6 Create a new project $ cargo new hello_cargo Build (compile) the project $ cargo build Compile and Run the project $ cargo run Hello World Program \u00b6 hello world fn main () { println! ( \"Hello, world!\" ); } As you can see, the syntax here is quite similar to C/C++, there are some differences though. fn here refers to function, and also ! is added behind println as println in Rust is a macro. (The meaning of macro would be introduced later). Variables and Mutability \u00b6 Like in C++ there are variables and constants, in Scala there are var and val , we use let to define new variables, but the variables are by default immutable. Immutability has a lot of advantages (check Wikipedia page for detailed explanations). To make the variable mutable, we should add the keyword mut at the beginning. let x = 5 ; let mut y = 6 ; const THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS : u32 = 60 * 60 * 3 ; Notice However, note that constants and immutable variables are different. The naming convention for naming constants is using all upper cases. Constants are valid for the entire time a program runs, within the scope they were declared in.","title":"Rust"},{"location":"cs/pl/rust/#rust","text":"Abstract A brief summary of what I have learnt about this language.
