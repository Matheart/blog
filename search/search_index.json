The language does not have a GC (Garbage Collector) but acheieve the purposes by its unique functionalities called ownership and lifetime . Many of the examples and sentences here are directly adopted from The Rust Programming Language . Basics \u00b6 Compile and Run \u00b6 When there's only one file, we can use rustc main.rs to compile (just like javac in Java ) and then use ./main.rs to run it. If things get complicated, we could make use of the powerful package manager of Rust, Cargo. It is easy to use, only several commands can satisfy most of the daily usage. Useful Commands \u00b6 Create a new project $ cargo new hello_cargo Build (compile) the project $ cargo build Compile and Run the project $ cargo run Hello World Program \u00b6 fn main () { println! ( \"Hello, world!\" ); } As you can see, the syntax here is quite similar to C/C++, there are some differences though. fn here refers to function, and also ! is added behind println as println in Rust is a macro. (The meaning of macro would be introduced later). Compilation / Runtime error of Rust \u00b6 Rust can give very powerful static checking during compilation and it can help you figure out most of the bugs before actually running the code with useful error message. Runtime error in Rust is called panic . Variables and Mutability \u00b6 we use let to define new variables, and we call this kind of value assignment as variable binding . Like in C++ there are variables and constants, in Scala there are var and val , we have mutable and immutable variables in Rust as well , but the variables are by default immutable as immutability has a lot of advantages (check Wikipedia page for detailed explanations). To make the variable mutable, we should add the keyword mut at the beginning. let x = 5 ; let mut y = 6 ; const THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS : u32 = 60 * 60 * 3 ; Notice However, note that constants and immutable variables are different. The naming convention for constants is using all upper cases. Constants are valid for the entire time when a program runs, within the scope they were declared in. Also, constants can only be set to a constant expression, not the result of a value that could only be computed during runtime. We can declare a new variable with the same name as previous variable and we call this kind of operation as shadowing . let y = 5 ; let y = y + 1 ; { let y = y * 2 ; println! ( \"The value of y in the inner scope is: {y}\" ); } Like this one, we first initialize the immutable variable y by binding 5 to it. Then we shadow y by y + 1 . Inside the curly brackets, we shadow y again, when the scope is over, the inner shadowing ends. So the output value should be 6. The following code can run smoothly: let spaces = \" \" ; spaces = spaces . len (); However, if we add mut to spaces . It would pop out errors because the compiler perceives it as mutating the type of the variable instead of shadowing, which is not allowed. Data Type \u00b6 Info As shown previously, we don't always need to write out the type explicitly ( let y = 5; ) unless the compiler requires more about the type information of the variable. If doing so, it would be like: let y: i32 = 5; , it is called type annotation . There are two data type subsets, namely Scalar Types and Compound Types . Scalar Type \u00b6 Integer Type \u00b6 u32 is one of the integer types, where u refers to unsigned, 32 refers to the number of bits. Similarly, there are i32 , u16 , u32 , i128 , ... By basic CS knowledge, it is trivial to calculate the range of each type. The isize and usize types depend on the architecture of the computer your program is running on, which is denoted in the table as \u201carch\u201d: 64 bits if you\u2019re on a 64-bit architecture and 32 bits if you\u2019re on a 32-bit architecture. We can call the functions usize::MIN , usize::MAX , isize::MIN , isize::MAX . The number literals can be represented under different basis. For example: 0xff , 0o77 , 0b1100_0100 , b'A' , 345_678 etc. One of the unique features of Rust is that it can insert _ inside the numbers to improve the readability like the binary number given above. We still need to handle the integer overflow issue in Rust. Wrap in all modes with the wrapping_* methods, such as wrapping_add Return the None value if there is overflow with the checked_* methods Return the value and a boolean indicating whether there was overflow with the overflowing_* methods Saturate at the value\u2019s minimum or maximum values with saturating_* methods let of_x : u8 = 233 ; let of_y : u8 = 133 ; of_x . wrapping_add ( of_y ); // 110 of_x . checked_add ( of_y ); // None of_x . overflowing_add ( of_y ). 1 ; // true of_x . saturating_add ( of_y )); // 255 Floating-point Type \u00b6 Only f32 and f64 . The boolean type and char type are similiar to C/C++. Compound Type \u00b6 Tuple Type \u00b6 Tuple has fixed length but allows its elements to have different types. We can use pattern matching to destructure a tuple value as following: fn main () { let tup = ( 500 , 6.4 , 1 ); let ( x , y , z ) = tup ; println! ( \"The value of y is: {y}\" ); } We could also access the components of them using the following syntax: tup . 0 ; tup . 1 ; tup . 2 ; Array Type \u00b6 The array still has fixed length but all elements inside must have the same type. It is not as flexible as the vector type as it has varible length. However, the arrays are useful if you want your data to be allocated on the stack rather than the heap. let a : [ i32 ; 5 ] = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ]; let b = [ 3 ; 5 ]; // [3, 3, 3, 3, 3] We could access the elements by using the following syntax: a [ 0 ]; a [ 1 ]; a [ 2 ]; Rust can pop out runtime errors when we have invalid array element access. use std :: io ; fn main () { let a = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ]; println! ( \"Please enter an array index.\" ); let mut index = String :: new (); io :: stdin () . read_line ( & mut index ) . expect ( \"Failed to read line\" ); let index : usize = index . trim () . parse () . expect ( \"Index entered was not a number\" ); let element = a [ index ]; println! ( \"The value of the element at index {index} is: {element}\" ); } We neglect the very detail of this program at this moment, we only care about if we input 6 as index, the following error would pop out while C / C++ cannot: thread 'main' panicked at 'index out of bounds: the len is 5 but the index is 10', src/main.rs:19:19 note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace This actually shows Rust's memory safety principles in action. It is very hard to debug if having invalid array elements access in C/C++ because it would trigger unexpected modification of data in other side of the program. String Type \u00b6 Function \u00b6 A typical example: fn plus_two ( x : i32 , y : i32 ) -> i32 { x + y } We use : i32 to give type annotation on the incoming arguments, and -> refers to the return type. () (unit type) stands for nothing is returned. You may notice no ; is put behind x + y , this shows the difference between statement and expression . Statements are instructions that perform a certain action, while expressions evaluate to a resulting value. Like the one above is an expression, where ; should noe be added. Another example: let x = ( let y = 6 ); This one is incorrect, if you want to bind the value of y to x, the correct code should be: let x = { let y = 6 ; y }; Comments \u00b6 Comments in Rust are just similiar to C/C++. // Hello, // we are comments! Documentation Comments would be written later here. Control Flows \u00b6 if Expressions \u00b6 One Example (no parenthesis is needed): if number < 5 { println! ( \"condition was true\" ); } else { println! ( \"condition was false\" ); } Note that the following code cannot compiled unlike C/C++: fn main () { let number = 3 ; if number { println! ( \"number was three\" ); } } The integer cannot be directly casted into bool. So should write if number != 0 . Nested if is the same as C/C++. There's one useful syntactic sugar: let number = if condition { 5 } else { 6 }; Reminders The types of results of two expressions should be the same since number can only have one type. loops \u00b6 loop \u00b6 This is the endless loop which can only be stopped by the break command: loop { bruhbruhbruh ; if flag { break ; } } If there are nested loops, we could label the loops and indicate their names during break. fn main () { let mut count = 0 ; ' counting_up : loop { println! ( \"count = {count}\" ); let mut remaining = 10 ; loop { println! ( \"remaining = {remaining}\" ); if remaining == 9 { break ; } if count == 2 { break 'counting_up ; } remaining -= 1 ; } count += 1 ; } println! ( \"End count = {count}\" ); } Besides, we could use while and for loop as well: While loop: while number != 0 { println! ( \"{number}!\" ); number -= 1 ; } for loop: let a = [ 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 ]; for element in a { println! ( \"the value is: {element}\" ); } for number in ( 1 .. 4 ) { println! ( \"{number}!\" ); } Here (1..4) refers to [1, 4) just like Python, to refer to [1, 4] , we should use (1..=4) instead. * Ownership \u00b6 Info Ownership is Rust\u2019s most unique feature and has deep implications for the rest of the language. It enables Rust to make memory safety guarantees without needing a garbage collector, so it\u2019s important to understand how ownership works. It governs how a Rust program manages memory.
